# Resume

## It's my resume made with HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript to give it a dark mode.

Rather than having a normal paper resume, I thought it might be a good idea to have one that I built with code. (I still made a paper version of my resume available to download via a link on this resume.) I also used it as an opportunity, since it's a rather small and simple project, to learn how to create a dark mode toggle using the CSS :root pseudo-class.

### How to contribute

It's my resume. If you want to give me a job that I can put on my resume, cool. But otherwise please refrain from making any other kind of contribution to it. That said, if you'd like to use this as a template, feel free to fork, clone, and rename it.
